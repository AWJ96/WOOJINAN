      <h2>Self-Guided Inductive Vehicle with Embedded Control Systems</h2>
      <p><strong>Institution:</strong> Newcastle University<br>
         <strong>Period:</strong> Mar 2023 – Jul 2023</p>

      <p>
        This project involved the design and development of an autonomous inductive line-following vehicle using an <strong>Atmega16 microcontroller</strong>. The buggy was equipped with real-time <strong>Proportional-Derivative (PD) control</strong> to steer and manage propulsion based on feedback from inductive sensors embedded in the track.

      <h3>Key Contributions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed and implemented embedded control logic for real-time steering and speed regulation</li>
        <li>Developed modular hardware subsystems for sensing, actuation, and processing</li>
        <li>Fabricated and debugged PCBs, addressing signal noise and interference through waveform analysis</li>
        <li>Tested performance on complex curved tracks and optimized stability and responsiveness</li>
      </ul>
